Array are the data structure in which all item are stored in continuous chunk of memory. In array there is a new element of array after some certain memory count and the size every item take is also same. So we can find element with O(1) time complexity.

The time complexity for different operation of array is given as:

| ARRAY OPERATION                | TIME COMPLEXITY |
|:------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| Access i-th element            | O(1)            |
| Traverse all elements          | O(N)            |
| Override element at i-th index | O(1)            |
| Insert element E               | O(N)            |
| Delete element E               | O(N)            |
