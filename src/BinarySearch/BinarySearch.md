# Binary Search
Binary search is a way to find a specific value in a sorted list or array. Here's a simple explanation:
- Start: Begin with the entire sorted list.

- Middle: Check the middle element of the list.

- Compare: If the middle element is equal to the target value, you're done.

- Narrow Down: If the target value is less than the middle element, repeat the process with the left half of the list. If the target value is greater, repeat with the right half.

- Repeat: Continue narrowing down the search until you find the target value or determine that it's not in the list.

Binary search is efficient because it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, making it much faster than searching sequentially through every element.
