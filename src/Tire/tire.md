# Introduction 
Trie data structure is a tree-based data structure used for storing a collection of strings and performing efficient search operations on them. It follows the property that if two strings have a common prefix, then they will have the same ancestor in the trie. A trie can be used to sort a collection of strings alphabetically as well as search whether a string with a given prefix is present in the trie or not.
