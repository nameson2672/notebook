# Tree
A tree is a nonlinear data structure with nodes connected by directed or undirected edges, extending the concept of linked data structures. It has a root node and can have zero or more subtrees. Nodes with no children are called leaves, while nodes with at least one child are internal nodes. Nodes with the same parent are siblings. General trees, where each node may have zero or more children, are used in applications like file systems. Binary trees, a specialized case of general trees, have nodes with no more than two children. Binary search trees are a type of binary tree where nodes can be efficiently searched.
