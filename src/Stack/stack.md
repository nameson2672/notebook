# Stack

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a collection of elements with two main operations: push and pop. The stack is commonly used for managing function calls, storing temporary variables, and tracking program execution.

Stack Operations Summary:
- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removes the topmost element from the stack.
- Peek (Top): Retrieves the top element without removing it.
- Clear:	Removes all items from the stack.
